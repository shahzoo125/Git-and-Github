So for creating Version control file system you should install git  
-git init  (run this command to initialize )
-git status

After this when you create files in folder there will be three stages 
   1          2         3
Untracked   Staged   Tracked

Untracked: The currently stage where files are not added in Version Control System
Tracked  : The stage where files are added in Version Control System

So if i want to move file Untracked to Staged so here is commad 
-git add filename

Stage to Unstage again in Untacked 
-git rm --cached filename 

Now Staged to Tracked 
-git commit -m "files are added to tracked"

Now if you delete the file it can be recover 
-git rm index.html

To restore the file 
-git restore index.html


---------Github-----------
Before we are working on Local Environment Now want to push code to Github 
Local to Github 
Two Methods ssh or PAC(personal access token)
-git push

Existing Repository push
git remote add origin link 
git push origin master   (main ki jagha master islye kyon ke local me create kya to Master name hai git status kar ke check kar saktay ho)

Generate Personal Access Token(Classic)
Settings > Developer Mode > PAC
i have created for 30 days 

-git remote -v   (to check link)
-git remote set-url origin (link with token)
-git branch -M main
-git push -U origin main  or  -git push origin master


          -Github Repo-
Now what we can do with Github Reo
Clone - Github to local Copy the repository of other in our Local Pc
Fork  - Github to Github copy the repository of other User in our Repository 

git clone link
