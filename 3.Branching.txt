Branching
Every branch in git maintain its own copy like if we create and switch to that
branch called any name like dev, create new file so this file in dev branch .
it will not in old branch master

main , master  these are name of brances

main :   when we create repository on Github branch name wil be main
master:  when we create repository on Local branch name wil be main

it will create new branch dev (master se aik aur branch nikaal li dev )
-git checkout -B dev   
-git branch  (to check branch)

To switch branch 
-git switch dev
create a file so this file belong to dev branch it will not shown in master branch

So different people aik project par kaam kar rahe hai to wo copies bana lein ghy 
like agar aik book likh rahe hai to koe konsa page likh raha ho gha koe konsa
so they will create copies this is called Branches

----------Prodection Envireonment---------
Main code is in Master Branch , best working code 
Staging Branch kuch code isme ho gha for testing ,end user testing etc Production me nahi dala jata
dev branch , developer ka code push hota hai ,devops engineer etc


Head is your latest commit
To check Head command is :
-git log --oneline

Push branch Local to Github 
git push origin dev

-------Merge-------
So if we want to merge Master to Dev:
pull request > Create Pull request 
base <> compare
base jiske andar merge karna hai : master jisko merge karna hai
merge
-git checkout main
-git pull origin main 

it will merge main from dev

--------Fetch, Pull---------
-git branch fetch 
Jitni branches github par hon ghi wo local me fetch ho jae ghi
  
Remote ke branch ke changes ko agar local me change karna hai to pull request bana kar local me pull karna hota hai
